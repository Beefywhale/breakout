# breakout
WIP rouglike game framework using SFML.

# WIP
Seriously this is a Work in Progress, so you're free to use it but it's missing ALOT and it's limited in use.
If you want to see it's current state look <a href="https://github.com/Beefywhale/breakout/releases">here</a>.

# Requirements
* SFML 2.5.0

# Usage
Documentation <a href="http://beefywhale.tk/breakout/docs/#CClass:Actor">here</a>

Check the <a href="https://github.com/Beefywhale/breakout/tree/master/examples">examples</a> folder for an example main file, then build that with SFML as a dependency. You'll need to copy the `font.ttf` to where you built the executable.
