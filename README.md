# breakout
WIP rouglike game framework using SFML.

# WIP
Seriously this is a Work in Progress, so you're free to use it but it's missing ALOT and it's limited in use.
If you want to see it's current state look <a href="https://github.com/Beefywhale/breakout/releases">here</a>.

# Requirements
* SFML 2.5.0

# Usage
Documentation <a href="http://beefywhale.tk/breakout/doc/annotated.html">here</a>

Check the <a href="https://github.com/Beefywhale/breakout/tree/master/breakout">examples/a>
Put this in a file named main.cpp and build it with SFML as a dependency. You'll need to copy the `font.ttf` to where you built the executable.
